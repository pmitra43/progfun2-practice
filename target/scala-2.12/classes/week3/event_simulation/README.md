# Discrete Event Simulation
### Functional Program Design in Scala

This is an implementation of the Discrete Event Simulation discussed on Coursera's course [Functional Program Design in Scala week 3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2/home/week/3)

The package contains only of scala codes which is a part of a bigger project, hence, no sbt file can be found here.
